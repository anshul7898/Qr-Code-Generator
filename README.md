What is a QR Code?

A Quick Response code is a two-dimensional pictographic code used for its fast readability and comparatively large storage capacity. The code consists of black modules arranged in a square pattern on a white background. The information encoded can be made up of any kind of data (e.g., binary, alphanumeric, or Kanji symbols)

For Linux Users Use Command in CMD - sudo apt-get update 
                                     sudo apt-get install python-qrtools
                                     
For Mac Users Use Command in Mac Terminal - brew install qrencode


You also need to install PyQRCode 1.2.1 Library of Python 

The pyqrcode module is a QR code generator that is simple to use and written in pure python. The module can automates most of the building process for creating QR codes. Most codes can be created using only two lines of code!

Unlike other generators, all of the helpers can be controlled manually. You are free to set any or all of the properties of your QR code.

QR codes can be saved as SVG, PNG (by using the pypng module), and plain text. They can also be displayed directly in most Linux terminal emulators. PIL is not used to render the image files.

The pyqrcode module attempts to follow the QR code standard as closely as possible. The terminology and the encodings used in pyqrcode come directly from the standard. This module also follows the algorithm laid out in the standard.

Requirements
The pyqrcode module only requires Python 2.6, Python 2.7, or Python 3. You may want to install pypng in order to render PNG files, but it is optional. Note, pypng is a pure python PNG writer which does not require any other libraries.
